This script is useful when you need to provide large amounts of code as input to OpenAI's language model via the web UI, e.g., for providing an entire git repository as context for responses.

ðŸ‘‰ Run the script using the command `python git-dump.py <directory>`, where <directory> is the path to the directory you want to copy text from.

ðŸ‘‰ The script will read the contents of all Python and C++ files in the specified directory and its subdirectories and split the output into chunks of 300 lines each.

ðŸ‘‰ After each chunk is generated, it will be copied to your clipboard, and you will be prompted to press Enter to continue.

ðŸ‘‰ Open the OpenAI GPT web UI in your web browser and start a new prompt.

ðŸ‘‰ Paste the copied chunk into the prompt and wait for the model to generate a response (it should reply "OK").

ðŸ‘‰ Return to your terminal and press Enter to generate the next chunk, which will be copied automatically to your clipboard.

ðŸ‘‰ Repeat the previous two steps until you've finished pasting all the chunks.
